# Hiring-Process-Analytics

### Project Description:-
The objective of this project was to analyze the hiring process data of our company 
to gain insights that could aid in improving our hiring strategies. We aimed to understand trends such as 
gender distribution of hires, average salary offered, salary distribution, departmental analysis, and position 
tier analysis. Our approach involved data analysis using Microsoft Excel to clean, process, and visualize the 
data, enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions.


### Approach:-
Approach: I began by examining the dataset containing records of previous hires. Our approach 
involved several steps:

**1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:** I checked for missing values, handled them appropriately, and 
consolidated columns where necessary to simplify analysis.

**2. Data Analysis:** I utilized various statistical measures and Excel functions to calculate averages, medians, 
and class intervals for salary distribution.

**3. Data Visualization:** I created charts and graphs to visualize hiring trends, departmental distribution, and 
position tier analysis


### Tools Used:-

**Microsoft Excel 2022** Purpose: We used Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, 
analysis, and visualization due to its powerful functionalities and ease of use in handling structured data.


### Insights:-

Insights: Through this project, we gained several key insights:

**- Gender Distribution:** We observed that numbers of males hired are almost double of number of females i.e. 
Males(4085) and Females (2675).So this gives an idea about company that it is more male driven company 
and it believes that Male are more effiecient in working than Female.

**-Average Salary:** The average salary offered by the company was calculated to be 49983.03 , providing a 
benchmark for salary negotiations.

**-Salary Distribution:** Class intervals were created to understand the salary distribution across different ranges.

**-Departmental Analysis:** We visualized the proportion of employees working in different departments, 
identifying areas of strength and potential growth.

**-Position Tier Analysis:** Analyzing position tiers helped us understand the distribution of roles within the 
company hierarchy
